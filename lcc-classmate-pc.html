                <p class="lead">
                    The Classmate PC, formerly known as Eduwise, is Intel's entry into the market for low-cost personal computers
                    for children in the developing world. It is in some respects similar to the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) trade
                    association's Children's Machine (XO), which has a similar target market. Although made for profit, the
                    production of the Classmate PC is considered an Information and Communication Technologies for Development
                    project. The device falls into the then popular category of netbooks.

                                    <p>
                                        Intel’s World Ahead Program was established May 2006. The program designed a platform for low cost
                                        laptops that third party manufacturers could use to produce low cost machines under their own
                                        respective brands.The Classmate PC is a reference design by Intel. Intel does not build the
                                        subnotebooks, but does produce the chips that power them. The reference design is then used by
                                        original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) worldwide to build their own branded Classmate PC.
                                    </p>

                                        Lenovo and Intel launched a new Classmate PC in 2011.

                                        Intel has had various partners with its iterations of the Classmate PC. Recently, the company has
                                        signed up Lenovo as a partner for the latest model, the Classmate+ PC. Reviews of the machine say
                                        that it's faster and more tamper proof.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The Lenovo carry handle is firmly in place at the back of the Classmate+ PC and it's powered by one
                                        of Intel's Atom processors, in this case a single core 1.6 GHz Atom N455 which is paired with
                                        Intel's NM10 chipset.
                                    </p>

                                        It will also come with up to 2GB of RAM, a standard netbook style 10.1-inch LCD screen, an option of
                                        either an 8 or 16GB SSD or a 160 or 250GB hard drive. Other features include 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi,
                                        10/100Mbit Ethernet, a 1.3Megapixel webcam, three USB 2.0 ports, a memory card reader, a D-sub

                                        Lenovo will supply three different battery packs for the Classmate+ PC, a standard 3-cell unit which
                                        is said to deliver 3-3.5h battery life depending on whether it's configured with a hard drive or
                                        SSD, a 4400mAh 6-cell pack good for between 7-7.5h and finally a 5200mAh high density 6-cell battery
                                        pack good for up to 8.5-9h of usage. The Classmate+ PC will only be available to qualified education
                                        and government customers through Lenovo or its channel partners.

                                    <h3>Latin America</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        In Latin America, contingent upon the receipt of sufficient international fund monies, the Mexican
                                        and Brazilian governments are evaluating whether to buy Intel's or the OLPC's laptop. Regardless of
                                        the hardware chosen, the Brazilian government announced that it would use the Linux operating
                                        system. It has been confirmed that Intel will be shipping the Laptops with Mandriva Linux, Discovery
                                        2007 edition as well as the Classmate 2.0 Linux distribution by the Brazilian company
                                        Metasys.Recently, Venezuelan government ordered 1 million Classmates from Portugal, one of several
                                        bilateral deals that Portuguese officials valued at more than US$3 billion.

                                        Oscar Clarke, President of Intel of Brasil, delivered thirty production units to the Brazilian
                                        Ministry of Education (MEC), for evaluation by SERPRO (Federal Data Processing Service of Brazil).It
                                        is currently available in Argentina made by 10 different brands of manufactures with OS like Linux
                                        and Windows also in Paraguay through HITECER S.A - TROVATO CISA GROUP. About the end of 2009,
                                        Argentina's government planned to give all the public high school students one of these netbooks.
                                        740 million U$S will be used to give all public schools routers and infrastructure to reduce the
                                        digital gap around the country.In 2011 Mexico detracted it's bid to buy several million Classmate
                                        PC's and instead selected a specialized variant of the Mexican built Lanix LT laptop series running
                                        Windows 7 to equip students in 16,000 schools across the country.

                                    <p>
                                        In 2009, State Government of Terengganu with cooperation from (Top IT Industries Sdn Bhd) and Intel
                                        Malaysia introduces CMPC through local brand TC (known as Top IT now) in Terengganu as e-book to
                                        replace the traditional text book in primary school all around Terengganu. First batch of E09 model
                                        landed on Terengganu on March 2009 and till now the State Government still providing CMPC to primary
                                        school students for free. Ranging from E09 (2009), E10 (2010) and the latest model E11 (2011 - till
                                        now) is given to give boost to ICT literacy to school children. In Asia, it has been available in
                                        Indonesia since early March 2008, through two local brands: Axioo and Zyrex. The Zyrex brand, called
                                        Anoa, is a rebranded Classmate PC equipped with the Intel ULV 900 MHz (400 MHz FSB) processor, 512
                                        MB RAM, 2 GB SSD, WiFi, LAN, 7 inch screen, 2 USB ports, card reader. The Classmate PC is available
                                        in Linux or Windows XP operating system, with the XP version incurring extra cost to cover the
                                        licensing.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The Classmate PC is currently available in India as Connoiseur Electronics Pvt.Ltd., Smartbook &
                                        Classmate PC series. This comes with Windows or Ubuntu Linux OS pre-installed. In late 2007, a deal
                                        was made with the Vietnamese government to supply local schools with a special Classmate PC for
                                        discounted price. As this version is loaded with Hacao Linux, the government was able to avoid
                                        operating system licensing fees.

                                    <h2>Comparisons with OLPC project</h2>

                                    <p>
                                        The Classmate PC represents Intel's competitive response to the OLPC XO, whose unusually low prices
                                        and use of AMD chips threatened to steal market share from Intel and other major manufacturers.
                                        Although Intel initially criticized the XO laptops for their lack of functionality—Intel's Chairman
                                        of the Board, Craig Barrett, himself claimed consumers wanted the full functionality of a PC—the
                                        Classmate PCs are currently being heavily marketed against the XO worldwide. Intel has already
                                        secured deals to sell hundreds of thousands of Classmate PCs to Libya, Nigeria and Pakistan, the
                                        same developing countries the OLPC project had been targeting.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The goals of the Classmate PC project and the OLPC project have some differences. According to
                                        Intel: the Classmate PC aims to provide technology that fits into the larger, primarily
                                        Windows-based computing environment. However, according to the OLPC, the XO breaks from the desktop
                                        metaphor to provide a UI (Sugar) that they feel is more suited to the educational needs of children.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        While the OLPC uses hardware and software highly customized for the educational environment, Intel
                                        has argued that the developing world wants to have generic PCs. In December 2005, Intel publicly
                                        dismissed the XO as a 'gadget'.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Intel joined the OLPC project in July 2007 and was widely expected to work on a version of the
                                        project's laptop that used an Intel chip, only to pull out of the project in January 2008. Intel
                                        spokesman Chuck Mulloy said it had pulled out because the OLPC organization had asked it to stop
                                        backing rival low-cost laptops, while OLPC's founder Nicholas Negroponte has accused Intel of
                                        underhand sales tactics and trying to block contracts to buy his machines.
