                                        One Laptop per Child (OLPC) is a project supported by the Miami-based One Laptop per Child
                                        Association (OLPCA) and the Cambridge-based OLPC Foundation (OLPCF), two U.S. non-profit
                                        organizations set up to oversee the creation of affordable educational devices for use in
                                        the developing world. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD,
                                        Chi Mei, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel, Red Hat, and
                                        Quanta.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In the first years of the project, the Association managed development and logistics, and
                                        the Foundation managed fundraising such as the Give One Get One campaign ("G1G1"). In 2010
                                        the Association set up a new office in Miami under Rodrigo Halaby, and currently oversees
                                        deployment and support for the XO-1.5 laptop and its successors, and country partnerships.
                                        The foundation, led by Chairman Nicholas Negroponte, currently oversees development of
                                        future software and hardware, including the ARM-based OLPC XO-1.75 laptop and the OLPC XO-3
                                        tablet.

                                        FAQ on official site of OLPC informs that as of 2011 there were over 2.4 million XO laptops
                                        delivered.

                                    <p>
                                        Intel was a member of the association for a brief period in 2007. It resigned its membership
                                        on 3 January 2008, citing disagreements with requests from OLPC's founder, Nicholas
                                        Negroponte, for Intel to stop dumping their Classmate PCs.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Ivan Krstić (former OLPC Director of Security Architecture) resigned in late February 2008
                                        because, he said, learning was not what the OLPC was about even for Negroponte. On April 22,
                                        2008, Walter Bender, who was the former President of Software and Content for the OLPC
                                        project, stepped down from his post and left OLPC to found Sugar Labs. Bender reportedly had
                                        a disagreement with Negroponte about the future of the OLPC and their future partnerships.
                                        Negroponte also showed some doubt about the exclusive use of open source software for the
                                        project and made suggestions supporting a move towards adding Windows XP which Microsoft was
                                        in the process of porting over to the XO hardware. Microsoft's Windows XP, however, is not
                                        seen by some as a sustainable operating system. Microsoft announced on May 16, 2008, that
                                        they have let them have Windows XP for $3 per computer. It would be offered as an option on
                                        XO-1 laptops and possibly be able to dual boot alongside Linux. However, no significant
                                        deployments elected to purchase Windows licenses.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Charles Kane became the new President and Chief Operating Officer of the OLPC Association on
                                        May 2, 2008. In late 2008, the NYC Department of Education began a project to purchase large
                                        numbers of XO computers for use by New York schoolchildren.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Advertisements for OLPC began streaming on the video streaming website Hulu and others in
                                        2008. One such ad has John Lennon advertising for OLPC, with an unknown voice actor
                                        redubbing over Lennon's voice.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The 2008 economic downturn and increased netbook competition reduced OLPC's annual budget
                                        from $12 million to $5 million and a major restructuring resulted effective January 7, 2009.
                                        Development of the Sugar operating environment was moved entirely into the community, the
                                        Latin America support organization was spun out and staff reductions, including Jim Gettys,
                                        affected approximately 50% of the paid employees. The remaining 32 staff members also saw
                                        salary reductions.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Despite the downsizing, OLPC continued development of the XO-1.5 laptops. Funding from
                                        Marvell, finalized in May 2010, revitalized the foundation and enabled the 1Q 2012
                                        completion of the ARM-based XO-1.75 laptops and initial prototypes of the XO-3 tablets. OLPC
                                        is now taking orders for mass production of the XO-1.75, and has shipped over 2.5 million
                                        XO-1 and XO-1.5 laptops.

                                    <p>
                                        The laptops are sold to governments, to be distributed through the ministries of education
                                        with the goal of distributing "one laptop per child". The laptops are given to students,
                                        similar to school uniforms and ultimately remain the property of the child. The operating
                                        system and software is localized to the languages of the participating countries.

                                    <h3>Early deployments</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Approximately 500 developer boards (Alpha-1) were distributed in mid-2006; 875 working
                                        prototypes (Beta 1) were delivered in late 2006; 2400 Beta-2 machines were distributed at
                                        the end of February 2007; full-scale production started November 6, 2007. Around one million
                                        units were manufactured in 2008.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Give 1 Get 1 program</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        OLPC initially stated that no consumer version of the XO laptop was planned. The project,
                                        however, later established the laptopgiving.org website to accept direct donations and ran a
                                        "Give 1 Get 1" (G1G1) offer starting on November 12, 2007. The offer was initially scheduled
                                        to run for only two weeks, but was extended until December 31, 2007 to meet demand. With a
                                        donation of $399 (plus US$25 shipping cost) to the OLPC "Give 1 Get 1" program, donors
                                        received an XO-1 laptop of their own and OLPC sent another on their behalf to a child in a
                                        developing country. Shipments of "Get 1" laptops sent to donors were restricted to addresses
                                        within the United States, its territories, and Canada.
                                        Some 83,500 people participated in the program. Delivery of all of the G1G1 laptops was
                                        completed by April 19, 2008. Delays were blamed on order fulfillment and shipment issues
                                        both within OLPC and with the outside contractors hired to manage those aspects of the G1G1
                                        program.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Give 1 Get 1 2008</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Between November 17 and December 31, 2008, a second G1G1 program was run through Amazon.com
                                        and Amazon.co.uk. This partnership was chosen specifically to solve the distribution issues
                                        of the G1G1 2007 program. The price to consumers was the same as in 2007, at US$399.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The program aimed to be available worldwide. Laptops could be delivered in the USA, in
                                        Canada and in more than 30 European countries, as well as in some Central and South American
                                        countries (Colombia, Haiti, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay), African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana,
                                        Nigeria, Madagascar, Rwanda) and Asian countries (Afghanistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
                                        Mongolia, Nepal). Despite this, the program sold only about 12,500 laptops and generated a
                                        mere $2.5 million – a 93 percent decline from the year before.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Promotional efforts</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        OLPC no longer advertises direct to consumers, focusing instead on fundraising efforts. In
                                        2011, they launched a new website designed by Pentagram and Upstatement.
