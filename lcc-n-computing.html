                                    <h3>Founding the company</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        In 2003, Young Song, a former VP at eMachines, met German entrepreneur Klaus Maier (formerly CEO of
                                        hydrapark), who had spent more than ten years developing the core software on which NComputing is
                                        based. They formed a team to develop the complementary hardware in Korea, while the software was
                                        written in Poland and Russia. After they successfully launched the product and reached $10M revenue
                                        in two years, the two founders decided to move its headquarters to Silicon Valley. Stephen Dukker,
                                        former chairman of eMachines, joined NComputing in August 2006, to lead the company together.

                                    <h3>Financing</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Dukker introduced NComputing to venture capitalists and technology journalists in September 2006 at
                                        DEMOfall 06. By October 2006, NComputing had raised $8 million from Scale Venture Partners (formerly
                                        known as BA Venture Partners). In January 2008, the company raised a $28 million series B round of
                                        financing, led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Menlo Ventures with participation from Scale
                                        Venture Partners and South Korea’s Daehong Technew Corp. In April 2012, the company raised a $21.8
                                        million series C round of financing led by Questmark Partners with participation from existing
                                        investors.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>N-series N400 and N500</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Both versions of N-series are only compatible with Citrix's XenApp, XenDesktop, Or VDI-in-a-box.
                                        N400: The N-series entry-level device, the N400, is the thin client of choice for task workers and
                                        those workers with light multimedia needs. The N400 combines the proven horsepower of the 3rd
                                        generation Numo™ 3 SoC with the deep understanding of desktop virtualization to support full HDX
                                        sessions up to HD780p and uses server-side rendering for video and flash video playback.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        N500: The workhorse of the N-series family of thin clients, the N500, provides the full multimedia
                                        capabilities demanded by knowledge workers and in other demanding environments. The N500
                                        incorporates full clientside rendering for efficient playback of video content, and uses server-side
                                        rendering for flash video playback. It displays content up to full HD at 1080p. The N500 also
                                        provides options for dual display and wireless connectivity (not available with the N400). Also
                                        powered by the Numo™ 3 SoC, the N500 sets the new standard for price/performance in the thin client
                                        market with its rich set of features and capabilities. Also comes in wireless.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>X-series - Direct Connect</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        X-series access devices connect via CAT 5 cable to a PCI card that is installed in a shared PC. The
                                        technology supports up to two PCI cards. The maximum distance between the PC and an access device is
                                        10 m (33 ft). The X-series comes in kits which include one PC card and several access terminals,
                                        depending on the specific product.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In a test published by Computer Aid International in April 2009 and conducted by three African
                                        universities, the X300 turned out to be the preferred solution when setting up computer labs.

                                    <h3>L-series - Ethernet connect</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Unlike the X-series, the NComputing L-series does not use a PCI card. L-series access devices
                                        connect each user’s keyboard, mouse, other USB devices and monitor back to the shared PC over
                                        standard Ethernet cables through a router or switch. An entry-level server supports approximately 30
                                        users. The L-series comes in kits that include NComputing’s vSpace software and one access device.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>U-series - USB connections</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        The U-series are the simplest of all to connect, because they connect into USB ports on the host
                                        computer, and thus no network switches or PCI cards are required. USB has an inherent distance
                                        limit.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>M-series - Multiple seats</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        The successor to the X series is the M300, which brings a new architecture and a new upper limit of
                                        45 users per host PC (15 three-client M300 kits). The M300 uses the Numo 2 ARM-based SoC (System on
                                        a chip) that provides HD video without excessive host-side processing.

                                        The M300 kit comprises three client devices, one 'large' and two 'small'. The large client serves as
                                        a hub for the two small clients, connected via STP and USB cables. Each of these devices can attach
                                        a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>vSpace Server software</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        NComputing’s vSpace Server virtualization software, included with the hardware, creates the virtual
                                        desktops in the shared PC by dividing the computer's resources into independent sessions that give
                                        each user their own PC experience. The vSpace software uses the company’s proprietary display and
                                        communications protocol ("UXP") to communicate between the shared computer and the user stations.
                                        UXP serves a similar purpose as Microsoft’s RDP and Citrix’s ICA.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Operating system support</h2>

                                    <h3>Linux support</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Linux is supported through a version of vSpace Server for Linux software. Currently, NComputing
                                        offers support for Ubuntu <=12.04.1. The vSpace Server software and hardware clients require
                                        registration after 30 days for product upgrade notification. This software is proprietary and is not
                                        regularly maintained. The last update was in December 2012.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Windows support</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Windows is supported through a version of vSpace Server for Windows software. The supported versions
                                        of Windows include: Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2, Windows XP SP3 (32-bit); Windows Server 2008 SP2,
                                        Windows Vista SP21(32-bit); Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows MultiPoint Server 2011, Windows 7
                                        SP1 (both 32- and 64-bit). The vSpace Server software and hardware clients require registration
                                        after 30 days for product upgrade notification.
                                    </p>
