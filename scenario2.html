                    <h2>Case study 2 - from the mountains of Nepal</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In this case study let's look at an example of a successful
                        IT-facilitated development project from one of the
                        most challenging locations in the world - Nangi village
                        in Nepal - and suggest that there are five lessons from
                        this small case that can be useful to the entire EGovernment
                        community.</p>

                    <p>The Nangi
                        village experience seems to be a metaphor for what is
                        possible when the five fundamentals of development
                        are met:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A comprehensive, agreed-upon plan</li>
                        <li>Enthusiastic participants and favorable publicity</li>
                        <li>Appropriate IT interventions</li>
                        <li>Sustained follow-on projects</li>
                        <li>Skilled leadership by home-grown talent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>A comprehensive, agreed-upon plan</h4>

                    <p>It has taken almost a decade to plan the development at the
                        village level to take advantage of the Internet through
                        establishing a connection that could assist in
                        improving health care, agriculture, education, thereby
                        improving the economy of the region. The project has
                        required several steps: first, getting electricity, then
                        setting up a high school computer lab and, a few years
                        later, developing a robust Wi-Fi network3
                        connecting four other villages and the Internet hub in Pokhara, a
                        large city about 22 miles away from the nearest relay
                        station. Mahabir Pun and a small team consisting of
                        undergraduates from UCLA and teachers from local
                        Nepali communities were able to set up the network in
                        about three weeks in September 2003.</p>

                    <h4>Enthusiastic, committed participants and favorable
                        publicity</h4>

                    <p>
                        The local villagers in Nangi were the biggest
                        supporters of this project, and also its greatest
                        beneficiaries. The support network stretches around
                        the world - from Nepal to the various equipment
                        manufacturers in the United States that supplied the
                        required network gear, to the foundations and
                        individual donors who gave sufficient funds to keep
                        the projects going, to the many volunteers, including
                        doctors from Pennsylvania State University and
                        University of Nebraska, and other sources like George
                        Mason University, Himanchal Education Foundation,
                        and UCLA.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Appropriate IT interventions</h4>

                    <p>
                        Many developmental projects, even in very poor
                        countries, try to use the very newest and most complex
                        equipment, reasoning that it will help the local project
                        to “leapfrog” ahead. In Nangi the model was very
                        different. Nangi did not have any funding available
                        when it started the wireless project in 2002. Therefore
                        the emphasis was on using the simplest, cheapest, and
                        used equipment and leveraging it to the maximum.
                        When it came time to set up a WiFi connection, the
                        emphasis was on strong, high-capacity, easily
                        maintained equipment, but the deployment strategy
                        included liberal use of very simple approaches, like
                        employing as many existing natural objects for
                        antenna placement as possible, including trees and
                        rocky crags. </p>

                    <h4>Skilled leadership by home-grown talent</h4>

                    <p>
                        Nangi and the other villages had several skilled
                        teachers, and Mahabir Pun was able to coordinate their
                        efforts effectively, thereby guaranteeing that there
                        would be a continuous transmission of expertise, new
                        ideas, and an increase in qualified people. Every
                        project needs a Mahabir Pun, a person who
                        understands the region but also has the wider vision to
                        integrate technology, political savvy, and a carefully
                        coordinated plan for a successful implementation. All
                        the volunteers from the United States and around the
                        world - doctors, dentists, nurses, college students etc. -
                        were particularly careful not to try to “take over”.
                        Instead, they were able to stimulate the village experts
                        to be more independent in their use of the training and
                        to spread the knowledge extensively. </p>

                    <h4>Sustained follow-on projects</h4>

                    <p>
                        One of the most interesting aspects of this project was
                        that once the villagers started communicating about
                        livestock, crops, health care and other useful subjects,
                        they found that there was a niche that would generate
                        other economic gains, and give some of a villagers a
                        new way to use their skills. A paper-manufacturing
                        business has come to Nangi3
                        . One of the villagers was
                        sent to Kathmandu for training and returned to train a
                        cadre of others. The result is a new way to leverage
                        both the technology and the inherent craftsmanship of
                        these villagers for creating highly saleable paper
                        products for upscale customers in larger cities in Asia.
                        Recently the villagers also started jam making
                        program from plums and juice making program from
                        rhododendron flowers hoping to sell the products in
                        the market. They feet that one of the indices of success
                        for development objects is not simply meeting the
                        goals, as difficult as that can be, but also establishing a
                        sense of progress that opens up many more
                        opportunities. That is what has happened in Nangi. </p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                    <p>They have suggested that there are five characteristics of
                        the Nangi experience that have made it a regional
                        success and a model for other implementations.
                        Unfortunately, literature indicates that most
                        development projects fail, even if extensive funding is
                        lavished on them. This one succeeded because it was
                        able to concentrate on the crucial elements of good
                        development practice. The carefully crafted plan
                        assured that the aims and means were well aligned.
                        Enthusiastic participants were frequently consulted
                        and their feedback and additional ideas have kept the
                        project on course for almost a decade. </p>
