                            <hr>
                            <p>In this case study let's look at an example of a successful
                                IT-facilitated development project from one of the
                                most challenging locations in the world - Nangi village
                                in Nepal - and suggest that there are five lessons from
                                this small case that can be useful to the entire EGovernment
                                community.</p>

                            <p>The Nangi
                                village experience seems to be a metaphor for what is
                                possible when the five fundamentals of development
                                are met:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A comprehensive, agreed-upon plan</li>
                                <li>Enthusiastic participants and favorable publicity</li>
                                <li>Appropriate IT interventions</li>
                                <li>Sustained follow-on projects</li>
                                <li>Skilled leadership by home-grown talent.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                            <h4>A comprehensive, agreed-upon plan</h4>

                            <p>It has taken almost a decade to plan the development at the
                                village level to take advantage of the Internet through
                                establishing a connection that could assist in
                                improving health care, agriculture, education, thereby
                                improving the economy of the region. The project has
                                required several steps: first, getting electricity, then
                                setting up a high school computer lab and, a few years
                                later, developing a robust Wi-Fi network3
                                connecting four other villages and the Internet hub in Pokhara, a
                                large city about 22 miles away from the nearest relay
                                station. Mahabir Pun and a small team consisting of
                                undergraduates from UCLA and teachers from local
                                Nepali communities were able to set up the network in
                                about three weeks in September 2003.</p>

                            <h4>Enthusiastic, committed participants and favorable
                                publicity</h4>

                            <p>
                                The local villagers in Nangi were the biggest
                                supporters of this project, and also its greatest
                                beneficiaries. The support network stretches around
                                the world - from Nepal to the various equipment
                                manufacturers in the United States that supplied the
                                required network gear, to the foundations and
                                individual donors who gave sufficient funds to keep
                                the projects going, to the many volunteers, including
                                doctors from Pennsylvania State University and
                                University of Nebraska, and other sources like George
                                Mason University, Himanchal Education Foundation,
                                and UCLA.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Appropriate IT interventions</h4>

                            <p>
                                Many developmental projects, even in very poor
                                countries, try to use the very newest and most complex
                                equipment, reasoning that it will help the local project
                                to “leapfrog” ahead. In Nangi the model was very
                                different. Nangi did not have any funding available
                                when it started the wireless project in 2002. Therefore
                                the emphasis was on using the simplest, cheapest, and
                                used equipment and leveraging it to the maximum.
                                When it came time to set up a WiFi connection, the
                                emphasis was on strong, high-capacity, easily
                                maintained equipment, but the deployment strategy
                                included liberal use of very simple approaches, like
                                employing as many existing natural objects for
                                antenna placement as possible, including trees and
                                rocky crags. </p>

                            <h4>Skilled leadership by home-grown talent</h4>

                            <p>
                                Nangi and the other villages had several skilled
                                teachers, and Mahabir Pun was able to coordinate their
                                efforts effectively, thereby guaranteeing that there
                                would be a continuous transmission of expertise, new
                                ideas, and an increase in qualified people. Every
                                project needs a Mahabir Pun, a person who
                                understands the region but also has the wider vision to
                                integrate technology, political savvy, and a carefully
                                coordinated plan for a successful implementation. All
                                the volunteers from the United States and around the
                                world - doctors, dentists, nurses, college students etc. -
                                were particularly careful not to try to “take over”.
                                Instead, they were able to stimulate the village experts
                                to be more independent in their use of the training and
                                to spread the knowledge extensively. </p>

                            <h4>Sustained follow-on projects</h4>

                            <p>
                                One of the most interesting aspects of this project was
                                that once the villagers started communicating about
                                livestock, crops, health care and other useful subjects,
                                they found that there was a niche that would generate
                                other economic gains, and give some of a villagers a
                                new way to use their skills. A paper-manufacturing
                                business has come to Nangi3
                                . One of the villagers was
                                sent to Kathmandu for training and returned to train a
                                cadre of others. The result is a new way to leverage
                                both the technology and the inherent craftsmanship of
                                these villagers for creating highly saleable paper
                                products for upscale customers in larger cities in Asia.
                                Recently the villagers also started jam making
                                program from plums and juice making program from
                                rhododendron flowers hoping to sell the products in
                                the market. They feet that one of the indices of success
                                for development objects is not simply meeting the
                                goals, as difficult as that can be, but also establishing a
                                sense of progress that opens up many more
                                opportunities. That is what has happened in Nangi. </p>

                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                            <p>They have suggested that there are five characteristics of
                                the Nangi experience that have made it a regional
                                success and a model for other implementations.
                                Unfortunately, literature indicates that most
                                development projects fail, even if extensive funding is
                                lavished on them. This one succeeded because it was
                                able to concentrate on the crucial elements of good
                                development practice. The carefully crafted plan
                                assured that the aims and means were well aligned.
                                Enthusiastic participants were frequently consulted
                                and their feedback and additional ideas have kept the
                                project on course for almost a decade. </p>
